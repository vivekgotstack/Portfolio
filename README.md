Vivek Nigam — Full Stack Developer

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

The goal of this project is simple: present my work, skills, and technical focus clearly and professionally, without gimmicks. The site is designed to reflect how I think about software—structured, modern, and pragmatic.

About Me

I’m a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student based in India, focused on full stack web development. My primary interests are backend systems, clean frontend architecture, and building reliable, production-grade applications.

I work primarily with Java and Spring Boot on the backend, and React with modern tooling on the frontend. I care about correctness, maintainability, and understanding why systems behave the way they do—not just making things work.

Project Focus

Minimal but deliberate design

There is no unnecessary animation, framework abuse, or overengineering. The codebase is meant to be readable and extensible.

Status

This project is actively maintained and evolves alongside my skills and experience. As I grow as an engineer, this portfolio grows with me.
